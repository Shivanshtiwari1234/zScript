## Archiving Note

This repository contains my first attempt at designing and implementing
a programming language interpreter in Python. 

It is archived because:
- The project predates proper Git and repository conventions
- The structure and commit history reflect early experimentation
- Build artifacts and other files were tracked unintentionally

The repository is preserved for historical and learning purposes.
Future development continues in a newer version.
